So I’ve discovered, learned and understood a lot of interesting things while building it.</p>\n<p>In this post I will try to document what I’ve learned on the road and what I am still struggling with.</p>\n<h2>Typography.js</h2>\n<p>Here is a very good high level explanation of the concenpts: <a href=\"http://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/what/\">http://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/what/</a></p>\n<p>Quick summary:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>scale identifies the relationship between elements, for example is p is 16px, and ration is 2, then h1 is 32</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>one rhythm is equal to one line-height</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>vertical rhythm - margin bottom 1 rhythm on all elements</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://kyleamathews.github.io/typography.js/\">Typography docs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Redux</h2>\n<p>I understand that redux isn’t necessary for this project, since it’s responsible for the theme toggling only. But I just wanted to practice with it.</p>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-get-started-with-gatsby-2-and-redux-ae1c543571ca\">Redux in Gatsby</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Rebassjs Grid</h2>\n<p>I am in a state when I haven’t decided how to handle the layout.</p>\n<p>In the very beginning I was avoiding CSS libraries, and did everything using <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp\">CSS Felxbox Model</a>. Then once I got pretty comfortable with it I discovered <a href=\"https://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a>. It made the development 2-3 times easier and faster. So when I switched to React, without any hesitation I moved to <a href=\"https://react-bootstrap.github.io/\">React-Boostrap</a>.</p>\n<p>A short while ago I realised that it’s not fair to stick to one library. So I’m experimenting with different layout libraries. I started with <a href=\"https://github.com/rebassjs/grid\">rebass grid</a>, because it’s compatible with <a href=\"https://www.styled-components.com/\">styled-components</a>.</p>\n<p>Eventually this library has some very cool features, like setting any proportion to the columns, easy setting of custom breakpoints and ability to pass properties in array for appropriate breakpoint.</p>\n<p>Links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/rebassjs/grid\">Rebass Grid docs</a></li>\n</ul>","timeToRead":2,"frontmatter":{"title":"On road learnings","date":"May 14, 2019","description":"(WIP) What I've learnet while building this blog with GatsbyJS","githubUrl":null,"liveUrl":null,"desktopImage":null,"mobileImage":null},"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/Dmtiry_An/Desktop/dmitriyaa.github.io/content/blog/learnings/index.md"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/learnings/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/flip-a-coin/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Flip a Coin"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/alice-in-wonderland/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Alice in Wonderland"}}}}
