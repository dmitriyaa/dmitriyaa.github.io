Need to improve :D</p>\n<p>In this blog I will try to document things that I’m learning (mostly front end related).</p>\n<p>I’ve got an inspiration for public learning from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/taniarascia\">Tania Rascia</a>. I think it is an awesome way to learn.</p>\n<p>The idea of building blog with Gatsby came from <a href=\"https://overreacted.io/\">overreacted.io</a> (I borrowed some features from there). I was really impressed by the ability to generate pages with .md files. Also I was impressed that anyone can modify/translate it via pull request on github. Speaking of pull request, your <a href=\"https://github.com/dmitriyaa/dmitriyaa.github.io/tree/implementation-3.0-gatsby\">countributions</a> are always welcome :)</p>\n<p>So this is my blog in a nutshell. Hope it will be helpful to someone.</p>","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"title":"First post and Blog reasoning","date":"May 13, 2019","description":"Testing post plus some thoughts about starting a blog","githubUrl":null,"liveUrl":null,"desktopImage":null,"mobileImage":null},"fileAbsolutePath":"/Users/Dmtiry_An/Desktop/dmitriyaa.github.io/content/blog/my-first-post/index.md"}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/my-first-post/","previous":null,"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/flip-a-coin/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Flip a Coin"}}}}
