# Reasonings and initial thoughts

[The current version of website](https://github.com/dmitriyaa/dmitriyaa.github.io/tree/development) has all the content in a single page.

I want to expand it by adding a blog, but I don't want to create a backend for this for a couple of reasons:

- I am a font-end developer and this is a good opportunity to practice with new technologies such as server rendering (next.js / gatsbyjs).

- I want to host the website on github pages, and don't want the backend to be somewhere else.
