# [Dmitriy's Workshop](https://dmitriyaa.github.io)

My personal workshop as well as my blog where I am learning and writing about new technologies and experimenting with them.

Powered by [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Gatsby](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog).

Inspired by [@taniarascia]https://twitter.com/taniarascia and [@dan_abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov).

## To run localy

Note:

Website is hosted on github pages, and by their convention, master branch should have the content that will be on the website. So the development is done on developmnet branch.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmitriyaa/dmitriyaa.github.io.git

cd dmitriyaa.github.io.git

git checkout origin/developmnet

yarn
```

```bash
yarn dev
```
