Here I will post things I want to learn or already learned. Along with resourses and my comments to them.
For some topics I might even write a separate blog post. We will see :)

- [x] .env file in create-react-app

  - the [official documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-custom-environment-variables) is pretty good.

- [] redux

  - The first thing to have a look at is [official documentation](https://redux.js.org/introduction/getting-started).

  - Dan Abramov's [course](https://egghead.io/courses/getting-started-with-redux) on egghead.io is great for understanding the concept, but not enough to be able to use redux right after the course.

  - Pluralsign's [course](<(https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-redux-react-router-es6)>) by Cory House gave me a more or less good understanding of the flow and project structure with react.
