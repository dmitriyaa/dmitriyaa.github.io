```js
console.log("Hello World")

This website was my playground for a long time. I use it to experiment with new technologies. It was rebuilt more than 3 times already. It started as a simple HTML + CSS website. Then I added some JS. Then rebuilt with Laravel. Then rebuilt with React. And now rebuilt with Gatsby.
