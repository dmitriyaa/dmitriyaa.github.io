Hi, my name is **Dima** (shortcut from Dmitriy) and I am **front end developer**.

I'm not really good at writing. Need to improve **:D**

In this blog I will try to document things that I'm learning (mostly front end related).

I've got an inspiration for public learning from [Tania Rascia](https://twitter.com/taniarascia). I think it is an awesome way to learn.

The idea of building blog with Gatsby came from [overreacted.io](https://overreacted.io/) (even borrowed some features from there). I was really impressed by the ability to generate pages with .md files. Also I was impressed that anyone can modify/translate it via pull request on github. Speaking of pull request, your [countributions](https://github.com/dmitriyaa/dmitriyaa.github.io/tree/implementation-3.0-gatsby) are always welcome :)

So this is my blog in a nutshell. Hope it will be helpful to someone.
